## 0.1.0 - 2026-09-10

First public release: local AI coding orchestration with a task baseline, a
bounded review/fix loop and repository policy guards.

### Added

- Local AI coding orchestration pipeline (PLAN -> IMPLEMENT -> TEST -> REVIEW
  -> FIX loop -> FINAL_GATE -> DONE)
- Persistent task state machine with audited transitions and resume after
  process restart
- Official Codex CLI implementer (prompt streamed on stdin, no OpenAI API key
  required)
- Codex execution path that works with a ChatGPT-subscription-authenticated
  Codex CLI login
- Manual planner workflow (Task Packet `plan show` / `plan import`)
- Manual reviewer workflow (`review export` / `review import`)
- OpenAI-compatible reviewer provider for HTTP review endpoints
- Dirty-workspace task baselines: pre-existing tracked/untracked changes,
  staged and unstaged mixes, deletions, renames and binary files are captured
  without touching the user's real Git index
- Task-relative diffs: reviewers and reports see the baseline -> current
  workspace delta, never HEAD-relative attribution of pre-existing user work
- Durable baseline recovery: byte-faithful `tracked.patch` plus untracked
  blobs, reconstructed and SHA-verified after `git gc` prunes the baseline tree
- Git repository policy guards: HEAD, branch, tag, other local refs and real
  index staging are snapshotted before/after every provider run; violations
  BLOCK the task and are never auto-repaired
- Interrupted provider attempt recovery: persisted attempt lifecycle, post-run
  evidence for exceptions/timeouts/KeyboardInterrupt, fail-closed restart
  requiring explicit human acknowledgement
- Reviewer secret redaction (best-effort pattern based) applied at a single
  boundary shared by the remote and manual reviewer paths
- CLI commands: `init`, `doctor`, `start`, `status`, `plan`, `continue`,
  `diff`, `logs`, `review`, `final`, `unblock`, `version`
- Artifact/evidence generation per task (baseline, implementation reports,
  review requests/results, logs, policy snapshots, final report)
- Release/final gate with a human-readable `final/report.md` answering "why is
  this task considered complete?"

### Security

- No ChatGPT credential scraping, no browser/session automation, no
  undocumented authentication paths
- No OpenAI API key requirement for the Codex CLI execution path
- `shell=False` subprocess execution with argv lists and timeouts
- Git HEAD/branch/ref/index mutation guards with structured violations
- Fail-closed handling of conflicted or otherwise unverifiable Git index state
  (blocked before a provider run can start)
- Best-effort reviewer secret redaction (not a data-loss-prevention system)
- Push prevention remains **provider-limited / best-effort**: the local
  postcondition check cannot mathematically prove that no `git push` happened

### Known limitations

- One active task at a time (no concurrency)
- One implementer: the official Codex CLI
- No MCP server, ChatGPT plugin, web UI or VS Code extension yet
- No mathematical push prevention (see Security)
- Reviewer redaction is pattern-based best effort, not DLP
- Structured Codex event stream (`codex exec --json`) is not parsed yet
- Remaining P3 backlog tracked for a later release:
  - dead HEAD-relative helpers in `GitWorkspace` (unused since task-relative
    deltas landed)
  - `unblock` clears the raw `blocked_reason` field (the audit trail, policy
    snapshots and attempt evidence are retained)
  - files marked `assume-unchanged` / `skip-worktree` do not appear in
    `preexisting_dirty_files` metadata (the task delta itself stays correct)
  - `final/report.md` header line is rendered at the moment of approval
